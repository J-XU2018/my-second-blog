13. database
  db = SqliteDatabase("student.db")
  class Student(Model):

    class Meta:
##for PeeWee/Django tell the model what database it belongs to, also many things, which field shoud have index, default
        database = db
##check other attribute to find more
14. if __name__ == '__main__':
    db.connect()
    db.create_tables([Student], safe=True)
  //safetly creat our tables

15. command line: ls -->find students.db
                  sqlite3 students.db
                sqlite> .tables
                        select * from students
                        .exit
16. further learn Peewee Model method, eg: create(), select(), save(), get(), delete_instance()
17, further learn data structure,
    students = [{'name':'Pet', 'poin':12},{'name':'Ka','poin':14},{}]

    def add_students():
      for student in students:
        Student.create(username=student['name'],points=student['poin'])
18 CRUD : create, read, update, delete
19 Peewee's convention is to import everything with *.
  Why is this usually considered a bad practice?
    .your local namespace suddenly gets flooded by a huge number of items
    things u've defined locally, or already imported, cn be overwritten by the import
    Peewee's contents are no longer contained in the peewee namespace
20 __name__ is a special variable that refers to the current namespace.
21  """ :called Doc string
22  To prevent code from being executed when you import a module,
  put it into a function or class, or inside  if __name__ == '__main__'
23. once creat the database instance,
    db = SqliteDatabase('challenge.db')
  /Create a variable named db that is an SqliteDatabase with a filename of challenges.db
    def initialize():
      db.connect()
      db.create_tables([Model name], safe=True)
24 from collections import OrderedDict ,,check all in collections, superise waiting there
25 Tuple is a common way to create a Dict: dict(a list), the list like :[('a', functionA), ('b', funcB),...] or [('a', 1), ('b', 2) ...] or.....
